This is to be kept a secret, if administration finds out about this it may be shut down and everyone will know that you're a little snitch.

Remember, snitches get stiches.

Skynet is a website I built to play broswer games and make it easier to share game files between people.

If you need a game (you don't, you just want it) contact me somehow and I'll make sure to do my best to get it up. 
The same thing goes with bugs or issues, if there is any issues find me somewhere and I'll make sure to iron out the bugs.
